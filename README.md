## IDEX Cartesian 3D printer using Ender 3 frame and components

Currently working on it so CAD files not available yet

Idea:
- Reuse owened Ender 3 V2 as much as possible
- Dual independent Toolhead
- Able to print with different materials and colours
- 180x180 print area to increase speed(needs testing)
- Future possibility of dual stepper motor Y axis

Decisions:
- Modified EVA 3 Toolhead for compatbilty
- Prusa mini heatbed
- CAN Bus
- Belted Z with singles stepper motor
- X and Y motion systems with linear rails for increased speed
- BL-Touch for simple bed leveling and bed meshing
